(There was an error rendering your Notebook: the 'state' key is missing from 'metadata.widgets'. Add 'state' to each, or remove 'metadata.widgets'.)
I ran into some issues trying to upload my file from google codelab so if you have a similar issue use this code:




import nbformat

notebook_filename = "dataanalyst.ipynb"

with open(notebook_filename, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    nb = nbformat.read(f, as_version=4)

if "widgets" in nb.metadata:
    del nb.metadata["widgets"]

cleaned_filename = "Cleaned_dataanalyst.ipynb"
with open(cleaned_filename, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    nbformat.write(nb, f)

print("Notebook cleaned and saved as", cleaned_filename)


(OFC CHANGE YOUR NOTEBOOK NAME) works like a charm.
